# projetfinal

For this project, like mention on the requirement paper, I picked something that I know I would truly 
enjoy making. For this project I use Html , JavaScript and CSS.

The project is build mobile first and  I have two media queries @media screen and (min-
width: 600px) and (max-width: 767px) and
 @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) for Desktop 
I use different ccs features, but the one that I really like was flex box (Flexible box).
I use flex box in all my media queries breakpoint to display my pictures like I want to.
 create a div container with a total of 8 photos, display flex.  I arrange the div inside (that contains all 8 pics) using flexbox
I use flex-wrap: wrap to allow images to display on multiple lines rather than a single line.
I display the div inside as a block because by default images will display inline like text.
Use flex-basis: 100% The width setting for mobile, one image per line.
Increase images per line as the page browse get bigger using the first query to display 2 pictures per line.
Display 4 images per line when width is more than 768px.


. I use JavaScript quite a bit on this project, not for anything too major. 
I use JS for my hamburger menu when the screen size is smaller, 
To display the background images on my header I created an automatic slideshow with two images 
 as well, which changes every 10 seconds. 
I also use JavaScript to add a live weather update whenever page refreshes or whenever click on the 
refresh button that I added. Create an Open Weather account, after signing up I generated a key 
Made a request, after receiving the data, I parse it JSON.parse() and get all the info that I need to show 
on my website. 
I also added an animation when you hover over the weather container ( it shakes a little bit .)
Finally I added and html page “places.html” with some js , I have a ton of picture you can view by one , by 2 and 4 .
